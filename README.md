# Google URL Shortener Desktop

My first attempt at learning C# by developing a Google URL Shortener Windows
desktop application using WPF.

This app is simply a GUI that uses the
[Google URL Shortener API](https://goo.gl/1uh11c) to do the same exact thing as
[goo.gl](https://goo.gl/), but without having to go to a web browser every time.

### Requirements

* Have .NET Framework >= 4.5.2
* Enable the [Google URL Shortener API](https://goo.gl/pZbaF)
* Prepare an API Key [here](https://goo.gl/kkvx2K)

### Usage

* Clone the repo to a directory of your choice and `cd` to that directory
* Open `GoogleURLShortenerDesktop.sln` in Visual Studio and Build
(Ctrl + Shift + B)
* Run `GoogleURLShortenerDesktop.exe`
